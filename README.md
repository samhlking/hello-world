## Markdown: Basic Syntax
I just love **bold text**.

---

Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

---

This text is ***really important***.

### Some More Syntax

Regular text is easy to add.
So is adding line breaks.

So is adding a new paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
> - First item
> - Second item

```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
